WPA_SUPPLICANT
________________________________________________________________________________

wpa_supplicant is a cross-platform supplicant with support for WEP, WPA and WPA2
(IEEE 802.11i). It is suitable for desktops, laptops and embedded systems. It is 
the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It implements
key negotiation with a WPA authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 
802.11 authentication/association of the wireless driver. [0]

Wireless Configuration (managed via dhcpcd)

Managed Wireles via dhcpcdjj
________________________________________________________________________________

Assuming that you have reached this page after following the KISS Installation
Guide, then have probably already installed dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant packages.
All that is left is to create new managed services via busybox's runsv for 
wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd:

$ ln -s /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/10-wpa_supplicant /usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/
$ ln -s /etc/sv/dhcpcd/ /var/service

At this point, you will want to create a wpa_supplicant file to store your 
wireless network information and credentials:

$ mkdir /etc/wpa_supplicant
$ touch /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

The following @/wpa_supplicant.conf can be used as a "starter" configuration
file. Remember to replace the <BSSID> and <PASSWORD> with your actual wireless
network credentials. For additional network requirements, refer to the 
"wpa_supplicant" Arch Linux Wiki page [0].


Generating a Passphrase:
________________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: This section is not required but HIGHLY recommend since storing your
      password in plain text is not a good practice. 

To allow for quicker connections to a network whose SSID is already known, we
can make use of wpa_passphrase, a command line tool which generates the minimal
configuration needed by wpa_supplicant: 

$ wpa_passphrase <SSID> <PASSWORD>

Replace <SSID> and <PASSWORD> with your actual wireless network credentials. The
output of this command can then be used to replace the network section of the 
wpa_supplicant.conf file created in the previous section (just remember to
delete the line containing your password in clear text).
